                <h2>How Hackers Can Steal Your Information in Unexpected Ways, and How to Stop Them</h2>
                <p>At a high level, <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/understanding-side-channel-attack-basics/ ">Side Channel Attacks</a> exploit security vulnerabilities in a computer’s hardware and physical nature. Bearing the name “Side Channel,” this category covers a very wide range of attacks (essentially everything apart from breaking into a computer or network directly). In this blog, I am going to give an explanation on the theory behind some different types of side channel attacks as well as some mitigation strategies.</p>
				<h3>Why is cybersecurity important?</h3>
                <p>This topic is only relevant if you care about protecting your information. This includes things like private messages/emails, personal documents, credit cards, and passwords. Since computers and online accounts are so integrated into our lives, making sure that accounts that belong to you stay yours and secrets you want to send stay secret is especially important. A step in protecting all of this includes making sure that computers and computer networks are secure. Software (most of it at least) has been built with this in mind, but it's not perfect.</p>
