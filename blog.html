				<h2>How Hackers Can Steal Your Information in Unexpected Ways, and How to Stop Them</h2>
				<p>At a high level, <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/understanding-side-channel-attack-basics/ ">Side Channel Attacks</a> exploit security vulnerabilities in a computer’s hardware and physical nature. Bearing the name “Side Channel,” this category covers a very wide range of attacks (essentially everything apart from breaking into a computer or network directly). In this blog, I am going to give an explanation on the theory behind some different types of side channel attacks as well as some mitigation strategies.</p>
				<h3>Why is cybersecurity important?</h3>
				<p>This topic is only relevant if you care about protecting your information. This includes things like private messages/emails, personal documents, credit cards, and passwords. Since computers and online accounts are so integrated into our lives, making sure that accounts that belong to you stay yours and secrets you want to send stay secret is especially important. A step in protecting all of this includes making sure that computers and computer networks are secure. Software (most of it at least) has been built with this in mind, but it's not perfect.</p>
				<h3>Cryptography</h3>
				<p>Some definitions: encryptions are scrambles of text into an unknown and different form, and cryptography is the process of this scrambling. Encryption can protect things like your passwords by hiding what they actually are. Most applications and computers that use the internet will automatically do the encryption without you needing to do anything.</p>
				<h3>Side Channel Attacks (SCAs)</h3>
				<p>Most Side channel attacks use information from unconventional channels to break cryptographic algorithms and get past the encryption on a message. As Jake Hertz <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/understanding-side-channel-attack-basics/">writes</a>, they are especially dangerous because these channels are usually not well protected. I will also introduce what I think is a fun, but scary one: acoustic SCAs. The side channel attacks I will discuss here are Power, Timing, and Acoustic side channel attacks.</p>
				<h3>Power SCAs</h3>
				<p>A power side channel attack uses the power consumption of a computer as its avenue of attack. An <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cryptography4020015">article</a> from the cryptography journal explains that the reason this method exists and works is because a computer will use different amounts of power when doing different operations. During a cryptographic algorithm, the computer needs to do certain operations to encrypt a message. If the attacker can record the power usage of the computer during this process, they can make a graph similar to this one.</p>
				<p>If the attacker knows how the encryption scheme works, they can correlate each spike in the graph to an operation, and use that knowledge to learn how to un-encrypt the message.</p>
				<p>More advanced kinds of power side channel attacks also exist. There are <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cryptography4020015">differential power analysis attacks and correlated power analysis attacks</a>, briefly introduced in this <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/a-basic-introduction-to-power-based-side-channel-attacks/">post</a> by Jake Hertz. The general idea of differential power analysis is to use statistical methods to reduce noise (extra, useless information that is recorded). Correlated power analysis uses regression/machine learning models to make correlations between power usage and the message that is getting encrypted. Both of these are very powerful, but the details are too much for me to go into here.</p>
				<p>Mitigating strategies can be put in hardware. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cryptography4020015">article</a> from the cryptography describes a few ways to do this. The gist of it is to add more randomness to the hardware to reduce the correlation between input and power consumption. For people who just use computers and care a lot about privacy, making sure that your power consumption is not recorded will be enough to prevent this sort of attack.</p>
				<h3>Timing SCAs</h3>
				<p>A Timing side channel attack uses the execution time of a computer program (how long it takes to finish). In most cases, (similar to the power SCA), it uses the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7987067">execution time of the encryption algorithm</a>. This sort of attack is weaker than a power SCA, as time will not leak as much information as power consumption which shows spikes in power usage, but it is much easier to just record timing versus detailed power consumption.</p>
				<p>Mitigating strategies involve making the software take a similar amount of time without depending on the input. This <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7987067">article</a> from IEEE describes at a detailed level on how a programmer can counter it. There is an issue with balancing this however, because we don’t want to algorithm to take a long time to run, and this is a strategy that needs to be employed by a software developer instead of someone just using it. Avoiding this sort of attack is similar to avoiding direct software attacks/viruses: just make sure not to use shady software.</p>
				<h3>Acoustic SCAs</h3>
				<p>I think the most interesting type of side channel attack is an acoustic side channel attack. While some low level versions of this attack use sounds that a CPU makes to determine what it's doing, a scarier option is using the sounds that a keyboard makes. This <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2403.08740">article</a> from researchers at Augusta University describes this much more relevant usage of this channel: After recording the sounds that a keyboard makes, the recording can be put through machine learning models and regression models to determine what was typed. Why is this so dangerous? If you are simply typing some things in public, a malicious person can record your keyboard sounds and determine exactly what you typed. Passwords, messages, emails, credit card numbers; if you are typing it, it's at risk of being exposed. As artificial intelligence becomes more and more powerful, these techniques can even be applied to sounds recorded from typing on a phone.</p>
				<p>Mitigating this is much harder. Even if you were to never work in an outside environment, if the information you are working with is valuable enough a dedicated attacker can insert recording devices wherever you are working, and record the sounds of you using the computer. To be honest, there's no real way to truly stop this sort of attack, but you can do your best to stop it by restricting the amount of sensitive information you input into your computer or phone while in places vulnerable to recording.</p>
				<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
				<p>Thankfully, most of the information that we as insignificant people have is not worth going through all this effort to try and steal. But if you are working with things that absolutely must be protected, it's important for you to be aware that an attacker can use these means to try and steal those secrets.</p>
